## SOC Analysis Lab

This repo showcases my ongoing cybersecurity detection and analysis projects, with a focus on packet capture investigations, threat hunting, and SOC-level reporting.

Each folder includes:
-  A full writeup simulating a real-world incident report
-  Key indicators of compromise (IOCs)
-  Custom tools or parsing logic (when applicable)
-  Screenshots or supporting artifacts

I started this project to document my learning and build out a portfolio of actionable skills — everything here is hands-on and manually analyzed.

###  Current Project: Nemotodes PCAP Analysis

In this case study, I analyzed suspicious network traffic from a medical research facility that experienced a malware infection.  
The traffic included encoded HTTP requests, potential C2 callbacks, and behavior consistent with early-stage compromise.
