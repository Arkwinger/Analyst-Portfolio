## SOC Analysis Projects

This repo showcases my ongoing cybersecurity detection and analysis projects, with a focus on SIEM investigations, threat hunting, and digital forensics.


I started this project to document my learning and build out a portfolio of actionable skills — everything here is hands-on and manually analyzed. These projects simulate real world SOC environments: monitoring systems, responding to threats, and using the tools that real teams use.

###  Current Project: Nemotodes PCAP Analysis

In this case study, I analyzed suspicious network traffic from a medical research facility that experienced a malware infection.  
The traffic included encoded HTTP requests, potential C2 callbacks, and behavior consistent with early-stage compromise.


##  Active Projects
